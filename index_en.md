## Before you start...

As the title indicates, this is a **Classical Japanese** course.

I wrote this book because there are no Classical Japanese textbooks on the market. I'm not saying that you can't find something on the Internet that allows you to learn Classical Japanese; on the contrary, there are quite a number of reference books that explain classical Japanese in detail. But in the final analysis, reference books are not textbooks, and they are not friendly to beginners.

In addition, you may find some videos explaining Classical Japanese on the Internet. But also unfortunately, they all assume that the viewer has a considerable previous knowledge. In other words, strictly speaking, they are not tutorials from scratch.

But Classical Japanese should not be considered as a subordinate to Modern Japanese; from a linguistic perspective, it should be considered as a separate language, like other ancient languages and modern languages. Just as one does not need a prior knowledge of French or Italian to learn Latin, so Classical Japanese does not necessarily have to be learned on the basis of Modern Japanese. From a practical perspective, those who are interested in ancient Japan may not be interested in modern Japan, and it would be an unnecessary expenditure of effort to learn Modern Japanese just to read a few ancient texts of Classical Japanese.

This tutorial is designed for those who do not have previous knowledge in modern Japanese and linguistics, but still want to learn classical Japanese. However, it is important to note that this tutorial is intended for native speakers of Chinese. Although no prior knowledge of Modern Japanese is required, it is assumed that the reader is a native speaker of Chinese and that general knowledge of the language may be involved. Besides, this tutorial introduces Classical Japanese around Classical Japanese literature, so in addition to knowledge of the language, it will also cover relevant historical and cultural knowledge.

This website will be continuously updated in the coming months (the table of contents is for reference only and subject to change).
